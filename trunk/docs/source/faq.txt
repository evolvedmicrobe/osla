What are the recovery mechanisms for errors within Clarity?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since error recovery will be different for different instruments, each
instrument interface defines its own recovery mechanisms. These mechanisms can
be accessed through Clarity's GUI.

If human intervention is necessary, Clarity's scheduling engine makes it easy to
re-run past instructions and restart protocol execution.

What does Clarity look like when it is running?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We have a screenshot :ref:`here<screen>`.
