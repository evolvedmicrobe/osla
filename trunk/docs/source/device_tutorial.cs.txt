Creating a Custom Device
========================



Introduction
++++++++++++

.. highlight:: c#

We create a virtual device with a single user callable activity, ``HelloWorld``,
that sends an email to a prespecified address.

This device is written in ``C#``, but any Common Language Infrastructure
language could be used (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages).

Preliminaries
+++++++++++++

All devices interfaces have to be members of ``BaseDeviceInterface``::

  using System;
  namespace Clarity {  
    public class HelloDevice : BaseDeviceInterface
    {

SMTP Client
+++++++++++

We need a function to

::

        private SmtpClient createSmtpClient()
        {
            SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com");
            //client.UseDefaultCredentials = false;
            client.Port = 587;
            client.EnableSsl = true;
            client.Credentials = new NetworkCredential("clarity.lab.automation@gmail.com", "icontrolrobots");
            return client;
        }
